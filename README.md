# Kora Client

> Frontend repository for the kora web app | [live preview](https://kora.vercel.app)

### Introduction
Kora is a side project I developed for learning purposes. It's a clone of the popular question/answer thread app [Quora](https://quora.com). This is the front-end repository built with :purple_heart: and VueJS, deployed on vercel. The [backend repository](https://github.com/Mayowa-Ojo/kora-server) is hosted separately.

### Development
Requires Node >=v10 & Vue v2
```shell
$ mkdir <folder>
$ git clone https://github.com/Mayowa-Ojo/kora-client.git .
$ touch .env
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```

I do intend to keep developing this app (adding new features and fixing bugs) as I enjoyed building this one.
